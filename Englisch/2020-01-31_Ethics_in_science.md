## Rule Utilitarism

Act Utilitarism weighs the action on the consequences.

## Act Utilitarism

Rule Utilitarism weighs the action on the appropriation to the established rules.

## Deontology

### Definition

- uses rules to distinguish from right and wrong
- ethical actions follow universal moral laws (eg. don't lie, cheat etc.)
- no need to weigh costs and benefits of the situation (= consequentialism)

### Application

- follow the rules and your duty

### Criticism

- no real answers to most ethical questions
    - if someone wants to live in a brutal violent world it could be deontologieally right
- Kant said, that everybody is born with an organ to distinguish between good and bad, which is not the case

## Kantian Ethics

> *"Act with an maxime in which it could become an universal law"*
>
> *"So act as to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of any other, in every case as an end in itself, never as a means only"*

## Examples

- You find a wallet full of cash
    - Return the wallet with the cash inside, as applying the act of not returning the wallet universally would result in loss of possession for everyone, which isn't good
- Someone hits you
    - ???

## Clearview AI

- Image recognition
- Identification of perpetrators and victoms of crimes
- Only available for law enforcement agencies
- Built for research, not for surveillance

### Criticism

- Privacy

## Psychology

### Life with(out) a mother

- Scientists want to find out why babies are so attached to their mother
- Experiment conducted with 20 babies, 10 with and 10 without a mother
- Results show that the 10 babies without a mother died after 3.5 months, while the other 10 with a mother lived
- Reasons are expected to be:
    - Life with mother is important
    - Social connection
    - Motherly love

*Was the experiment morally reasoned?*

## The form of "Drilling"

Russian psychologists began experimenting with children in post-WW II. They wanted to "drill" them to create a perfect generation for the future, emotionless shells ready to fight and kill anything in their way. A perfect army on demand, representing the perfect country. Other countries, although unknown which ones, also began using this method of "drilling".

The disadvantages of the experiment were quite strong at the beginning. The first children died during the first trials, commiting suicide if they did survive however. Emotionless shells and mentally unstable children came to light, after the trials went better.

### Application of Kantian Ethics

We should only act *for* humans and not *with* humans, applying kantian ethics would mean an emotionless world where the only objective would be killing each other, ultimately resulting in death of humanity. The experiments would not be morally justified when applying kantian ethics.

### Application of Utilitarism

The experiments would not be morally correct, if the act utilitarism was applied, as the death puts the general net outcome in a negative balance. With the rule utilitarism however, everything would follow the established rules of creating emotionless killers.
