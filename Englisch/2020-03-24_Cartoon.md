# Cartoon description

![Excercise from the book](img/IMG_20200319_104447.jpg)

The cartoon depicts a market with a person in a protective full-body suit with the radioactivity symbol on the chest. He is selling various vegetables and fruits, which seem to be apples, oranges and cucumbers. The merchant is standing confidently behind the display of foods, with his arms behind his back. Each display of fresh farm products has multiple signs with the radioactivity symbol on it, labelled with different names such as "Valencia", "Harrow" or "Gala". A sign above the food products says "Fresh Farm Products". An old lady with food in her shopping bag is in front of the merchant, looking confused about the whole radioactivity ordeal.

The message of the cartoon is about organic products exposed to radioactivity or genetically modified food in general. GM food has been a controversial topic for a while and there are a lot of concerns about it regarding safety. The lady is unsure about how safe the foods are. The eerie appearance of the merchant in the full body suit also imposes a certain level of uncertainty about the products, further adding to the concerns of the lady. The "Fresh Farm Products" sign makes it more confusing, because the meaning of "fresh" contradicts with the radioactive nature of the products sold. While we would certainly not call those kinds of foods "fresh" in current times, I assume this is in the near future, where actual fresh food is in low supply and scientists have started experimenting more with GM foods, but too far in the future, as the lady still shows concerns of unsafe food instead of relying on science that has tested GM foods over multiple centuries. The naming of the products also makes it more apparent that the scene might be in the near future, as the products are altered in such a way, that the product cannot be considered the same as the original product anymore and specifically requires a new name for, what I presume is, a new fruit/vegetable.

The given quotes show the general concerns about GM foods. They relate to the cartoon in such a way, that those quotes could be the thoughts of the confused lady standing in front of a display of products exposed to radioactivity. The first quote is talking about making "irreversible changes in a random manner to a complex level of life about which is little known" and the other quote is talking about GM foods being untested and unpredictable. Both concerns can't be tested by simply observing GM foods, like one could easily recognize rotten fruit from the outside color or from the smell. The irreversible changes made to GM foods the first quote is talking about could also refer to the eco-system of plants.

The quotes voice very well reasoned concerns about GM foods. The cartoon might be a bit over the top with the full body suit of the merchant and therefore the double-edged nature of the comic, but overall represents the general ideas and concerns about GM foods as well.
